## Datacenter Asset Management

The Miniasset API serves a datacenter asset database via a json http api. This asset management database is meant to document the target status of the datacenter(s) - it is not meant to play the role of a monitoring service which records the actual status. From a system administrator's point of view, programmatic access to information and associations of datacenter assets is vital in order to build automated configuration management, monitoring and the services themselves on top. While commercial solutions cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, this seems a bit too much as a first step on the path to get rid of spread sheet management and sort of.
